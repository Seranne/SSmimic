## Background

The aim of our study is to identify if there is an association between a patient's demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status and insurance coverage) and our outcome of interest: prescription of IV opioid medication (yes = 1, no = 0). We also investigate if this association has shown a difference in trends over time, between the years 2002 and 2011. 

The following markdown is designed to search through the mimic database and generate a table containing details of patients with self-reported pain scores between the years 2002 and 2011, their demographic and clinical characteristics, and corresponding IV opioid prescription information. 

All patients with ICD-9 codes corresponding with drug dependence and abuse have been excluded.Patients with elixhauser scores greater than 10 have been excluded.

# Subsetting Mimic for Final Cohort. 
Demographic Characteristics: 
- subject_id, hadm_id, icustay_id, age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, insurance status, admit year, 
Clinical Characteristics: 
- mean pain, median pain, max pain, icu_los, oasis, e_score, 
Prescription Characteristics: 
- drug, drug_name_generic, formulary_drug_cd, form_unit_disp, route
Inclusion Criteria
- All patients with self-reported pain scores
To Exclude: 
- All patients with ICD - 9 codes for Drug Dependence or Abuse [codes beginning with 304 or 305]
- All patients with Elixhauser scores > 10


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(mgcv)
library(dplyr)
require("RPostgreSQL")
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```

The first chunk of code allows R to connect to MIMIC database:
```{r echo = F}
# Loads the PostgreSQL driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL") 

# Creates a connection to the postgres database (MIMIC)
# Note that "con" will be used later in each connection to the database

con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "mimic",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = "postgres")

dbGetQuery(con, "set search_path to mimiciii")
```

The following code chunks use tables derived from the MIMIC database to create a dataframe with all the variables of interest for each patient.

## Patient Details: Demographic and Admission Characteristics 
```{r echo = T}
# First table contains subject_id, hadm_id, icustay_id, age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, insurance status, los_hospital, los_icu. Excludes patients with ICD-9 diagnoses codes for drug dependence or abuse
# SQL code for Materialized View "ptdetails" available from SQLCode.txt
ptdetails <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from patientdetails")

# adding admityear: Permissions required to access Year data
years <- read_csv("/SSmimic/years.csv")
ptdetails <- merge(ptdetails, years, by = "hadm_id")

# Filter out years 2001 and 2012 as they are incomplete years
ptdetails <- filter(ptdetails, !ptdetails$admityear == "2001" & !ptdetails$admityear == "2012")

# Sets pts >89 yo (300 yo in database) to the median of 91.4
ptdetails$age[which(ptdetails$age > 300)] <- 91.4

# Removing duplicates
ptdetails <- ptdetails[-which(duplicated(ptdetails$hadm_id)),]

# Sample size
length(unique(ptdetails$hadm_id))
```


## Patient Details: Clinical Characteristics 
# Pain scores
```{r echo = T}
# Search through d_items table (containing item ids from both Metavision and CareVue databases) to derive item ids reflecting self-reported pain scores recorded in MIMIC
pain_items <- dbGetQuery(con, "select itemid, label from d_items where label like  '%pain%' or label like '%Pain%'")
pain_items
```

Looking at the table above, these are the following item_ids that will be used to obtain pain level from the chartevents tables: 1044 (Pain Level - CareVue), 1045 (Pain Level/Response - CareVue), 225813 (Baseline pain level - Metavision), 224409 (Pain Level Response - Metavision), 227881 (Pain (0-10)), 223791 (Pain Level - Metavision).

```{r echo = T}
# Select all pain level measurements from the chartevents table and convert all measures to the same format
pain_table <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from mimiciii.chartevents where itemid  in (1044, 1045, 225813, 224409, 227881, 223791)")
for(i in 1:nrow(pain_table)){
  if(length(
  unique(na.omit(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(unlist(pain_table$value[i]), 
                                            "[^0-9]+")))))) == 1){
    pain_table$valuenum[i] <- unique(na.omit(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(unlist(pain_table$value[i]), 
                                                                 "[^0-9]+")))))
  }
  if(length(
    unique(na.omit(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(unlist(pain_table$value[i]), 
                                              "[^0-9]+")))))) == 2){
                      pain_table$valuenum[i] <- 0
                                              }
}

```


```{r echo = T}

med.pain$med.pain <- as.numeric(med.pain$med.pain)

qplot(x = med.pain, data = med.pain, geom = "histogram")
```


```{r echo = T}

oasis <- dbGetQuery(con, "select subject_id, oasis from oasis")

# Eliminate duplicates in oasis

```
